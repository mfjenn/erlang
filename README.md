erlang
======

my first erlang tutorials

1) Clone the repo. 

2) To run the module, you must have elrang installed. You may download it at http://www.erlang.org/. 

3) To start the erlang shell, type in "erl". 

4) Run "c(useless)." to compile it. 

5) Once your shell is running, run each of the functions in the module by typing "useless:add(7,2)." , then  "useless:hello().", then "useless:greet_and_add_two(-3)."

6) Feel free to change the arguments given in the commands above to see what happens!. Note that the "hello" function does not accept an argument.
